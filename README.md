Inspiration
Obesity continues to plague our country, yet the present system is woefully inadequate. Current solutions focus on devising the best diet plan or most nutritious meal. However, the fundamental flaw with this approach is that we have enough diet plans, but we’re making the choice to adopt these plans far too late. We wanted to create a product that would revolutionize the struggle against obesity.

What it does
lekwgrm
“Weight and Watch” is a program that utilizes GPS technology to determine whether you have been in close proximity to a fast food chain or restaurant for a certain amount of time, and then logs and analyzes data. After a month, it generates a report detailing the number of times you ate outside, and provides you with meaningful analysis through multiple charts on how best to create an action plan to live healthier. Unlike any other weight loss programs in the market, (eg. NutriSystem) the initial stage of the process requires practically no user input. You can access your information through an Android device or Web Platform.

How we built it
We used many APIs, such as the Google Places API, JavaMail API, Firebase, Parse, and Facebook SDK to make sure that we could collect, sort, and analyze the data and send it to the user in an efficient manner. The Google Places API powers the end-to-end automation of the app, which will be connected to your Facebook account. We also used libraries such as d3.js and flot.js to display data in an aesthetically pleasing and informative manner.

Challenges we ran into
We ran into problems with Google's fraud detection and syncing Firebase and Parse together.

Accomplishments that we're proud oft
We are proud of our ability to take raw data and analyze it in such a way that the user can make informed decisions to better their lifestyle.

What's next for Weight and Watch
We plan to expand our user base and functionality.
